# Welcome to the Hummus Team Project: The _Rick and Morty_ multiverse interactive gallery ðŸ’¥

This is a team project with [Jimena NuÃ±ez](https://github.com/Jimenaaaaaa) and [JoaquÃ­n Bezanilla](https://github.com/jbokyes).

Take into account that this was our very first web application. We developed an interactive gallery with data of a public API. Working together was a truly enriching experience, and we were all eager to learn from one another.

Throughout the development process, we gained valuable experience working collaboratively as a team. Our collaborative efforts were facilitated by Git version control, which allowed us to work on the same branch and merge changes in a seamless and efficient manner.

We also leveraged the benefits of React to create an interactive and responsive user interface. By using React, we were able to implement modular and reusable components, making our code more efficient and maintainable. Additionally, we implemented various user experience (UX) best practices, such as intuitive navigation and clear visual hierarchy, to ensure that users had a positive and engaging experience.
